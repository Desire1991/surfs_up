# surfs_up

Overview of surfs_up


Purpose


The purpose of the challenge is to extract data from sqlite and then parse it to jupyter notebook in order to 
transform the data and figure out if there are trends, or any important patterns in a specific instance. In addition
The project used some data visualization with Flask, in which we had to set up a route as well as define functions that will help determine what will appear on screen for Flask.

Results


Through extracting data from both June and December from the hawaii sqlite dataset, there are many conclusions that can be inferred:

•	The June temperature averages are higher compared to the December temperature averages by about 3.9.

•	There are a total of 1700 datasets for June and there are 1517 datasets for December.

•	June Temperatures exceed the December Temperatures in every factor when describing the statistical data set(count,mean,min,max,25%,50%,75% quartile)


The shown tables will demonstrate the temperature for both months June and December summary.

Surfs_Up Summary


Based off of the results of the dataset we can see that June Temperatures are higher by all accounts compared to the December dataset, and therefore, the ice cream sales, as well as the number of people potentially going to the surf shop, due to the weather being warmer. 



This will give incentive for more customers to buy ice cream in order to relax and cool off from the sun and ride some waves to have fun. December may still have a considerable amount of people buying ice cream and surfing as it is not completely cold in some instances, but just expect more activity in the June area.



Two additional queries to gather specific data for June and December Months, may be to gather more data from different stations, as there may be different areas in Hawaii that may be hotter, or colder. This way if W.Avy is willing, he can branch out 
to different areas in Hawaii based on the station's measurement for temperature around the area. 



In addition, we can also measure the precipitation of Hawaii in order to get the feel of the fog density around the area, as it can affect sight and less people may want to surf when the precipitation is not good for surfing in many days.
